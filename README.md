Front End Mentor Project 4 - Product Preview Card Component (Newbie)

This is a challenge for Front End Mentor.  The goal is to copy the provided screenshot of a webpage.  It has a card in the middle of the screen with an image of perform.  It has several headers, description text, price tags, and an add to cart button.  There is also a condensed mobile version.  I will use the skills I've learned so far to try to recreate the image. I will also follow the provided branding guideline.

Some choices I made:

Add mobile version

Change image when screen size changes

Add hover state

Add favicon

Add flexbox
